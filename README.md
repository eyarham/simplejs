# Simple Javascript Examples

This repo is here to help you learn javascript through simple modifiable examples that can be run in any browser.

## Getting Started

For any file, you should be able to download and run the file in any browser, with no dependencies required.

Once it's running, you should be able to modify the file you're looking at using any text editor ([Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is free and works great), and see your changes reflected in the browser's rendered output!
